Increasing the signal to noise.

Networks connect people and computers.

Who has access to the network?

What does it allow them to access?

Do the networks help sharing of information?

Human computer networks
=======================

Computer networks connect people and allow them to share data and
information.

An organisation can work towards increasing the information flow
between its people.

There are also vast quantities of data, ideas, software, information
and ideas outside any the organisation than 

Think about networks, of people and computers and how information
flows.

On the computer side, organsiations should consider having
multiple networks: an open network, access is like an internet cafe.
A place to explore what is out there.

An internal network with no direct connection to the internet.  This
is where all the information that can be shared freely throughout the
organisation belongs.  Some of it can, and should, be shared with other
organisations.

Another internal network should be used for sensitive data that cannot
be shared widely through the organisation.  Several such networks may
be needed depending on how much of this sort of information there is
and how disparate the subsets of people are that need access.

Separate physical locations for the different networks may be
desirable, they help remind what sort of data you are dealing with,
who it is shared with.

Between these different networks, for example, between the outside
network and the internal open network you might have a network which
is open to the outside, but has all the data, software and ideas that
you choose to share with the world.

This is where you can see what you can do with the help of others.
Where others you never knew are already helping.

This can act as a bridge to bring new ideas from the outside into your
internal networks.
