Related to this, it is becoming easier and easier to acquire this skill.   Once acquired it opens up a vast universe of exploration.

At PyParis Nicholas Tollevy gave an excellent micro-bit tutorial.

He has written a simple editor for python: https://codewith.mu/ 

He had 30 microbits: micro-bit, usb lead, external battery pack and connectors.

He also had some crocodile clip leads and a speaker.

All we had to do was download mu, install and start it.

Plug in the microbit and see somethings run across the LED screen.

Enter:

     from microbit import *
     
     display.scroll("hello world!")

Press "flash" and your code is written to the microbit and runs.

Press the "repl" button and you get an interactive python interpretter on the microbit.

Connect the speaker with croc clips and you have music and speech.

There are buttons, a compass, temperature sensor and an accelerometer.

So we are at a sweet spot time when there are lots of easy accessible tools to use and explore.

The communities around these devices help people keep pace with the changes in the world, so a small investment in learning can have a big payback in future learning and adventure.

I think its easy to miss the fact that the ability to program has become a skill akin to wielding a hammer, a hoe, shovel, or saw. To ignore that this activity represents a direct connection to a person's ability to engineer the world around them or even their own lives will be akin to a mesopotamian refusing to learn the basics of agriculture

I think the focus on coding isn't always helpful.

But coding as a way to better understand what computers can do is helpful.

Maybe we should just call it "conversations with computers".

The rapid change the world is going through, the recent emergence of super powerful, low energy, high density storage combined with sensor data is making it easier and easier for people to explore their world for themselves.

So a thousand people might have what they think is a great idea for a start up, one of them might even turn into a viable business.   But there are a lot of "uber for dogs" type failures.

More interesting to me is the contrast between building your own device using general purpose components that can be re-purposed versus buying the latest shiny gadget.

Since we've had so many cheerleading pieces about coding lately, here is a more jaundiced view written in a pale imitation of Hunter Thompson's acerbic style. A rather confused mixture of railing against useless tech and the tangled history of the Deep South.

Whilst I agree with his point about the utter pointlessness of many current startups, he doesn't seem to understand the delights of doing something just to do it, an outlook that will become increasingly important as traditional jobs disappear. It used to be a rite of passage to write The Best Editor Ever or The Best Programming Language. Did the world need these? No, but the creators had a lot of fun and learned a lot. Some even became hugely successful.
